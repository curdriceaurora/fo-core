"""Tests for ``services.inference_timer`` (#410).

Verifies that:
- elapsed_ms is recorded on both success and exception paths,
- the log line fires only when ``mark_invoked()`` was called or the
  body raised (no log for purely pre-inference scopes),
- the ``kind`` argument lands in the log prefix verbatim.
