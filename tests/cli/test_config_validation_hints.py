"""Test that config edit errors include valid-values hints.

Step 3 replaced bare "must be one of [...]" messages with the new
`format_validation_error` helper, which adds a "did you mean" suggestion
when the input is a near-typo. Pins both:
- The valid-values list appears verbatim (so `_VALID_*` constant
  additions automatically flow into the message).
- A near-typo gets a `'did you mean ...'` suggestion.
