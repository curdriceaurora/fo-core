## Organizing Files

### Basic Organization

The `organize` command analyzes files in an input directory and moves them to categorized folders in an output directory:

```bash
# Dry run first to preview changes
file-organizer organize ~/Downloads ~/Organized --dry-run

# Run the actual organization
file-organizer organize ~/Downloads ~/Organized

# Verbose output for debugging
file-organizer organize ~/Downloads ~/Organized --verbose
```

### Previewing Changes

Use `preview` for a quick dry-run view:

```bash
file-organizer preview ~/Downloads
```

### Searching Files

Search through organized files by filename pattern or keyword:

```bash
file-organizer search "quarterly report" ~/Organized
```

### Analyzing Individual Files

Inspect what the AI detects about a specific file:

```bash
file-organizer analyze ~/Documents/report.pdf
```

## Copilot

The Copilot is an AI assistant that can answer questions about your files and perform management tasks using natural language.

### Interactive Chat (REPL)

```bash
# Start an interactive session
file-organizer copilot chat

# Specify a working directory
file-organizer copilot chat --dir ~/Documents
```

### Single-Shot Mode

```bash
# Ask a single question
file-organizer copilot chat "How many PDF files are in my Documents folder?"
```

## Daemon and Background Processing

The daemon watches directories for new files and organizes them automatically.

### Starting the Daemon

```bash
# Watch a directory
file-organizer daemon start --watch-dir ~/Downloads --output-dir ~/Organized

# Run in foreground (useful for debugging)
file-organizer daemon start --watch-dir ~/Downloads --output-dir ~/Organized --foreground

# Adjust poll interval (seconds)
file-organizer daemon start --watch-dir ~/Downloads --output-dir ~/Organized --poll-interval 30

# Dry-run mode (log actions without moving files)
file-organizer daemon start --watch-dir ~/Downloads --output-dir ~/Organized --dry-run
```

### Managing the Daemon

```bash
# Check daemon status
file-organizer daemon status

# Stop the daemon
file-organizer daemon stop
```

## Organization Methodologies

File Organizer supports multiple organization systems. Configure these through the `config edit` command.

### Default AI Organization

The default method uses AI to analyze file content and suggest categories based on the content itself, not just file extensions.

### PARA Method

Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive -- a productivity-focused system:

- **Projects**: Active work with deadlines
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities
- **Resources**: Reference materials by topic
- **Archive**: Completed or inactive items

### Johnny Decimal

A numerical categorization system using `XX.YY` numbering:

- **Areas** (10-19, 20-29, ...): Broad categories
- **Categories** (X1, X2, ...): Specific sub-categories
- **IDs** (XX.01, XX.02, ...): Individual items

## Deduplication

Find and resolve duplicate files using perceptual hashing (for images) and content-based comparison (for documents).

### Scanning for Duplicates

```bash
file-organizer dedupe scan ~/Documents
```

### Resolving Duplicates

```bash
file-organizer dedupe resolve ~/Documents
```

### Generating Reports

```bash
file-organizer dedupe report ~/Documents
```

!!! note
    Image deduplication requires the dedup optional pack: `pip install -e ".[dedup]"`

## Auto-Tagging

The auto-tagging system suggests and applies tags to files based on AI analysis of their content.

### Getting Tag Suggestions

```bash
# Suggest tags for files in a directory
file-organizer autotag suggest ~/Documents
```

### Applying Tags

```bash
# Apply specific tags to a file
file-organizer autotag apply ~/Documents/report.pdf finance quarterly
```

### Viewing Popular Tags

```bash
# List the most commonly used tags
file-organizer autotag popular
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Tag files in batch
file-organizer autotag batch ~/Documents

# View recently applied tags
file-organizer autotag recent
```

## Organization Rules

Rules let you override AI decisions with explicit patterns. When a file matches a rule, it is organized according to that rule instead of the AI suggestion.

### Listing Rules

```bash
# List all rules
file-organizer rules list

# List rule sets
file-organizer rules sets
```

### Adding Rules

```bash
file-organizer rules add my-rule --pattern "*.invoice.*" --action move --dest "Documents/Financial"
```

### Previewing and Managing Rules

```bash
# Preview what a rule would match in a directory
file-organizer rules preview ~/Documents

# Remove a rule
file-organizer rules remove my-rule

# Export rules to a YAML file
file-organizer rules export --output rules-backup.yaml

# Import rules from a YAML file
file-organizer rules import rules-backup.yaml
```

## Smart Suggestions

Get AI-powered suggestions for where to place files based on your existing directory structure and past organization patterns.

### Getting Suggestions

```bash
# Suggest placements for files
file-organizer suggest files ~/Unsorted

# View detected patterns
file-organizer suggest patterns ~/Unsorted
```

### Applying Suggestions

```bash
file-organizer suggest apply ~/Unsorted
```

## Analytics

View storage analytics, file distribution, and organization metrics.

```bash
# Display analytics dashboard
file-organizer analytics
```

## Profiles

Profiles allow you to save and switch between different configuration sets. This is useful for managing separate environments (e.g., work vs. personal).

### Managing Profiles

```bash
# List all profiles
file-organizer profile list

# Show current active profile
file-organizer profile current

# Create a new profile
file-organizer profile create work

# Activate a profile
file-organizer profile activate work

# Delete a profile
file-organizer profile delete old-profile
```

### Exporting and Importing

```bash
# Export a profile (--output is required)
file-organizer profile export work --output work-profile.json

# Import a profile from a JSON file
file-organizer profile import work-profile.json

# Merge two or more profiles into a new one (--output is required)
file-organizer profile merge work personal --output combined
```

## Undo and Redo

All file move operations are tracked and reversible.

```bash
# Undo the last operation
file-organizer undo

# Redo the last undone operation
file-organizer redo

# View operation history
file-organizer history
```

## Configuration

### Viewing Configuration

```bash
# Show current configuration
file-organizer config show

# Show configuration for a specific profile
file-organizer config show --profile work

# List available configuration profiles
file-organizer config list
```

### Editing Configuration

## Privacy and Security

File Organizer is designed to keep your data completely private:

- All AI processing runs locally through Ollama -- no files or content are uploaded to any cloud service.
- Network requests are limited to:
  - Communicating with your local Ollama instance (localhost only)
  - Checking for application updates (optional, can be disabled)
- No telemetry, analytics, or usage tracking of any kind.

## Troubleshooting

### Ollama Not Running

If you see connection errors, ensure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama ps
```

If no models are listed, pull the required models:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct-q4_K_M
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b-q4_K_M
```

### Verbose Output

Add `--verbose` (or `-v`) to any command for detailed logging:

```bash
file-organizer organize ~/Downloads ~/Organized --verbose
```

### Checking Health

Verify Ollama and the application are working:

```bash
file-organizer doctor .
```

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
