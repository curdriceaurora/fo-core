# Epic: Enhanced User Experience (Phase 2)

**Timeline:** Weeks 3-4
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** High

## Overview
Improve the user interface and experience with interactive features, better CLI, and easier installation. Phase 2 builds the user-facing layer on top of the Phase 3-5 backend (audio, dedup, intelligence, daemon, parallel processing, undo/redo, analytics).

## Key Features

### 1. Copilot Mode 🤖
Interactive chat interface for natural language file organization
- Chat with AI: "read and rename all PDFs"
- Multi-turn conversations
- Save custom organization rules
- Preview changes before applying

### 2. CLI Model Switching 🔄
Dynamic AI model selection
- List available models
- Switch between text/vision/audio models
- Compare model performance
- Auto-download missing models

### 3. Interactive TUI 📺
Terminal user interface with Textual
- File browser with preview
- Live organization preview
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Select/deselect files

### 4. Improved CLI ⌨️
Enhanced command-line with Typer
- Subcommands: organize, preview, undo, config
- Integrate existing Phase 4 CLI modules (dedupe, autotag, profile, analytics)
- Auto-completion support
- Better help text
- Interactive prompts

### 5. Configuration System ⚙️
YAML-based unified configuration
- User preferences
- Default options
- Exclusion patterns
- Multiple profiles
- Wraps existing Phase 5 module configs (watcher, daemon, parallel, events)

### 6. Cross-Platform Executables 📦
Pre-built binaries for easy installation
- macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Windows (.exe)
- Linux (AppImage)
- One-click installation
- Auto-update mechanism

## Success Criteria
- [ ] TUI fully functional
- [ ] User satisfaction >4.0/5
- [ ] Setup time <10 minutes
- [ ] Error clarity improved 50%
- [ ] Cross-platform executables available

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (project minimum, set in Phase 5)
- Typer >=0.12.0 (CLI framework)
- Textual >=0.50.0 (TUI framework)
- PyYAML >=6.0.0 (config files)
- PyInstaller (executables)

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 complete ✅
- Phase 3 (audio, PARA, JD) - partially complete, integration tasks depend on it
- Phase 4 (dedup, intelligence, undo, analytics) - complete ✅
- Phase 5 (events, daemon, parallel, docker) - complete ✅
