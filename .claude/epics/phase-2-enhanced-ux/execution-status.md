**Total chain:** 96 hours (≈12 working days)

## Buffers
- **Project buffer:** 48 hours (≈6 working days, 50% of chain)
- **Buffer thresholds:**
  - Green: <33% penetration
  - Yellow: 33–66% penetration
  - Red: >66% penetration

**Current buffer penetration:** 0% (no chain work recorded since baseline)

## Dates (Assuming Start on Feb 9, 2026)
- **Earliest finish (no buffer):** Feb 24, 2026
- **Buffered finish:** Mar 4, 2026

## Key Blockers
