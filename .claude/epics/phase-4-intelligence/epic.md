# Epic: Intelligence & Learning (Phase 4)

**Timeline:** Weeks 8-10
**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Medium-High

## Overview
Add intelligent features including deduplication, preference learning, and undo/redo functionality.

## Key Features

### 1. File Deduplication 🔍
Identify and remove duplicate files
- **Exact duplicates**: Hash-based detection (MD5/SHA256)
- **Similar images**: Perceptual hashing (pHash)
- **Similar documents**: Semantic similarity analysis
- User confirmation before deletion
- Keep best quality version
- Reclaim storage space reporting
- Safe mode with backups

### 2. User Preference Learning 🧠
Adapt to user's organization preferences
- Track user corrections and changes
- Learn naming patterns
- Remember folder preferences
- Improve suggestions over time
- Export/import preference profiles
- Per-directory learning
- Feedback loop integration

### 3. Undo/Redo System ⏮️
Revert organization operations
- Track all file operations
- Undo single operation
- Undo batch operations
- Redo operations
- Operation history viewer
- Configurable history limit
- Persistent across sessions

### 4. Smart Suggestions 💡
AI-powered recommendations
- Suggest organization improvements
- Detect organizational patterns
- Recommend folder structures
- Identify misplaced files
- Auto-tagging suggestions

### 5. Advanced Analytics 📊
Insights into file organization
- Storage usage analysis
- File type distribution
- Duplicate statistics
- Organization quality metrics
- Time saved calculations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Duplicate detection >99% accuracy
- [ ] Storage savings >20% average
- [ ] Preference learning improves over time
- [ ] Undo works 100% reliably
- [ ] User satisfaction with suggestions >80%

## Technical Requirements
- imagededup 0.3+ (perceptual hashing)
- scikit-learn 1.4+ (similarity detection)
- SQLite for operation history
- JSON for preference storage

## Dependencies
- Phase 3 complete
- Stable file organization patterns
