# Phase 3 Epic - Execution Status

## Completed and Merged ✅

**Parallel Execution Round 1 - CORRECTED:**

Note: 3 of 4 agents worked directly on main branch instead of worktree due to coordination issue.

**Completed on main branch:**
- ✅ #112: Add CAD file support - Completed on main (commits 7e17c2c-8c97d7d)
- ✅ #113: Add archive and scientific format support - Completed on main (commits 7c8acb6-dd0f4f4)
- ✅ #123: Enhance EPUB processing - Completed on main (commits 132e323-2387de8)

**Completed in worktree, merged to main:**
- ✅ #83: Implement Johnny Decimal numbering system - Merged via commit 678a564

## Previously Completed ✅
- #110: Design PARA categorization system
- #115: Integrate Distil-Whisper for audio transcription
- #117: Implement audio metadata extraction

## Progress: 43% (7/16 tasks complete)

## Remaining Sequential Tasks (6 tasks)
- #116: Write comprehensive tests for Phase 3 features
- #119: Update documentation and create user guides
- #81: Add PARA smart suggestions
- #118: Integrate Johnny Decimal with existing structures
- #120: Build audio content-based organization
- #121: Implement PARA folder generation

## Closed as Duplicate (3 video tasks)
- ~~#80: Add video transcription from audio track~~ - Closed 2026-01-24
- ~~#82: Enhance video metadata extraction~~ - Closed 2026-01-24
- ~~#122: Implement multi-frame video analysis~~ - Closed 2026-01-24 (never created on GitHub)
