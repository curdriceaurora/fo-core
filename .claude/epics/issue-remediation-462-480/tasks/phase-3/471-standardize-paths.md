# Task 471: Standardize storage/config/state paths

## Description

Implement consistent path handling across all modules using XDG/platform-aware path resolution. Currently inconsistent path patterns cause migration complexity and user data location uncertainty.

## Priority

Critical - Foundation for migrations and cross-platform support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] XDG path resolution standard implemented
- [ ] Platform-aware path utilities created
- [ ] All module path handling refactored
- [ ] Migration framework implemented
- [ ] User data paths documented
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

## Files to Modify

- `src/file_organizer/config/paths.py` (new) - Path resolution utilities
- 10+ modules requiring path standardization
- Migration framework implementation

## Related Issues

- Migration recovery (#476)
- Future cross-platform support

## Blocking Issues

- None

## Blocked By

- None

## Dependencies

- Task #476 (Migration recovery) depends on this
- Foundation for cross-platform work

## Notes

- Very high effort (24-32 hours)
- Architectural change affecting multiple modules
- Critical for production data safety
- Must complete before #476
- Part of Phase 3: Architectural Foundation
