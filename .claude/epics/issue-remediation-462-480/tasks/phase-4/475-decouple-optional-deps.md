# Task 475: Decouple optional feature dependencies

## Description

Move optional dependencies (audio, video, CAD) to service-level imports instead of eager loading in core. Currently optional features still import eagerly, bloating core dependencies.

## Priority

Medium-High - Import cleanup and stability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audio feature imports moved to service level
- [ ] Video feature imports moved to service level
- [ ] CAD feature imports moved to service level
- [ ] Core imports no longer load optional dependencies
- [ ] Features work when dependencies installed
- [ ] Graceful fallback when dependencies missing

## Files to Modify

- `src/file_organizer/services/*/__init__.py` - Selective imports
- Core module imports - remove optional features

## Related Issues

- Import isolation (#466)
- Startup latency (#472)

## Blocking Issues

- None

## Blocked By

- Task #472 (Reduce startup latency) - should follow

## Dependencies

- Builds on Task #472: Reduce startup latency
- Supports Task #480: Tighten lint/type strictness

## Notes

- Medium effort (8-12 hours)
- Enables true optional feature handling
- Should follow lazy loading work (#472)
- Part of Phase 4: Code Quality & Maintainability
