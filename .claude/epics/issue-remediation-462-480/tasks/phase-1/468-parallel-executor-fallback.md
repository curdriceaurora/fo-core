# Task 468: Add ParallelProcessor executor fallback

## Description

Implement fallback chain for parallel execution: ProcessPoolExecutor → ThreadPoolExecutor. Ensures parallel processing doesn't crash in restricted environments (Docker, CI) where semaphore restrictions prevent multiprocessing.

## Priority

High - Stability improvement for restricted environments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ProcessPoolExecutor wrapped with exception handling
- [ ] ThreadPoolExecutor fallback implemented
- [ ] Executor fallback chain working correctly
- [ ] Tests pass in both process and thread modes
- [ ] No crashes in restricted environments (Docker, CI)

## Files to Modify

- `src/file_organizer/parallel/executor.py` - Implement fallback chain

## Related Issues

- Parallel processing reliability
- Docker/CI compatibility

## Blocking Issues

- None

## Blocked By

- None

## Notes

- Medium effort (4-6 hours)
- Critical for parallel processing reliability
- Part of Phase 1: Quick Wins & Stability
