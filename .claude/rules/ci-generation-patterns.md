## Pre-Generation Checklist (MANDATORY before writing any CI config)

- [ ] Read existing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` BEFORE adding any new workflow step
- [ ] Verify coverage threshold against `pyproject.toml` `cov-fail-under` value BEFORE documenting it
- [ ] Adding/bumping a dependency version? Run `pip index versions <package>` to confirm it exists on PyPI (C8)
- [ ] Check `@lru_cache` decorators on functions that read env vars — remove if found
- [ ] No wall-clock time limits in CI (`< 1s`, `< 5s`) — use relative assertions or skip entirely
- [ ] Measuring integration coverage? Run `bash .claude/scripts/measure-integration-coverage.sh` (erases `.coverage` first)

---

## Pattern C1: FLAKY_GATE — ~8 findings

**What it is**: Hard wall-clock time limits in CI (e.g., `assert duration < 1`) that fail under shared runner load; `time.sleep` in tests instead of event-based waits.

**Bad**:
```python
# BAD — strict wall-clock limit fails under CI load
start = time.time()
result = process_file(large_file)
assert time.time() - start < 1.0, "Processing too slow"

# BAD — time.sleep blocks test runner unnecessarily
time.sleep(2)
assert service.is_ready()
```

**Good**:
```python
# GOOD — relative threshold or no timing assertion
result = process_file(large_file)
assert result is not None  # skip timing in CI

# GOOD — poll with timeout instead of fixed sleep
import time
deadline = time.time() + 10
while time.time() < deadline:
    if service.is_ready():
        break
    time.sleep(0.1)
else:
    pytest.fail("Service not ready within 10s")
```

**Pre-generation check**: Search for `assert.*< [0-9]` in test files before adding timing assertions.

## Pattern C2: WRONG_TRIGGER — ~6 findings

**What it is**: Job runs on events where it shouldn't — e.g., coverage upload on `pull_request` events (partial suite gives misleading metrics), or expensive jobs running on every push to every branch.

**Bad**:
```yaml
# BAD — coverage upload on PR events (partial suite = wrong metrics)
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test-and-upload:
    steps:
      - run: pytest --cov
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

**Good**:
```yaml
# GOOD — coverage upload only on main push
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run: pytest --cov
      - name: Upload coverage (main only)
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

**Pre-generation check**: For every `uses:` action that writes to an external service (codecov, GitHub releases, etc.), add `if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`.

---

## Pattern C3: CACHE_MISCONFIG — ~5 findings

**What it is**: `@lru_cache` on functions that read env vars — cache holds stale values across test runs or when the env var changes between calls.

**Bad**:
```python
# BAD — cached function reads env var; cache never invalidated between tests
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_config_manager() -> ConfigManager:
    config_dir = os.environ.get("FO_CONFIG_DIR", "~/.config/fo")
    return ConfigManager(config_dir)
```

**Good**:
```python
# GOOD — no cache, fresh read each time (env may change in tests)
def get_config_manager() -> ConfigManager:
    config_dir = os.environ.get("FO_CONFIG_DIR", "~/.config/fo")
    return ConfigManager(config_dir)

# GOOD — if caching needed, use explicit invalidation
_config_manager: Optional[ConfigManager] = None

def get_config_manager() -> ConfigManager:
    global _config_manager
    if _config_manager is None:
        _config_manager = ConfigManager(os.environ.get("FO_CONFIG_DIR", "~/.config/fo"))
    return _config_manager

def reset_config_manager() -> None:
    global _config_manager
    _config_manager = None
```

**Pre-generation check**: Search for `@lru_cache` on any function that calls `os.environ.get` or `os.getenv`.

```bash
# Detection command
rg "@lru_cache" src/ -A 5 | grep -B 3 "environ\|getenv"
```

## Pattern C4: COVERAGE_GATE — 25 findings (most frequent CI pattern)

**What it is**: Coverage threshold declared in PR description, README, or docs doesn't match the value actually enforced in `pyproject.toml` or the workflow file.

**Bad**:
```markdown
<!-- In README.md — WRONG threshold -->
## CI Requirements
- Code coverage ≥ 74%

# In PR description — WRONG threshold
Coverage gate: 75%
```
*(Actual enforced value in pyproject.toml: `cov-fail-under = 95`)*

**Good**:
```bash
# ALWAYS check actual value before documenting
grep "cov-fail-under\|fail_under" pyproject.toml
# → cov-fail-under = 95

# THEN document the actual value
# "Code coverage gate: 95% (enforced via pyproject.toml cov-fail-under=95)"
```

**Pre-generation check**: Before writing any coverage percentage, confirm which gate
applies (see table above). For local unit test thresholds, run:

```bash
grep "cov-fail-under\|fail_under" pyproject.toml
```

For CI gates, read `.github/workflows/ci.yml` directly — multiple jobs enforce
different thresholds.

**Post-change sweep** (run after ANY threshold change): Find all stale references:

```bash
OLD=93; NEW=95
grep -rn "$OLD" docs/ .github/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md .claude/rules/ | grep -i "cover\|docstring\|gate\|threshold\|fail-under"
```

Update every hit before committing.

**Current project coverage gates** (verify before using — all are enforced in CI):

| Gate | Threshold | Where enforced | Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Unit test floor | **95%** line | `pyproject.toml` `cov-fail-under` | Local + all CI runs |
| PR diff coverage | **80%** line | `ci.yml` diff-cover step (files ≤75 changed) | PR only |
| Main push floor | **93%** line | `ci.yml` coverage-gate job | `push` to main |
| Integration floor | **71.9%** line+branch | `ci.yml` test-integration job | `push` to main |
| Docstring coverage | **95%** | `ci.yml` coverage-gate via interrogate | `push` to main |

When documenting a single number, use the gate that matches the context:
- Talking about local `pytest` runs → 95%
- Talking about PR CI → 80% diff coverage
- Talking about overall project health → 93% main

## Pattern C5: SECRET_EXPOSURE — ~4 findings

**What it is**: Tokens logged or passed via query string in CI context; env vars echoed in workflow steps.

**Bad**:
```yaml
# BAD — env var echoed to logs
- name: Debug
  run: echo "Token is ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"

# BAD — secret passed as CLI argument (visible in process list)
- run: python script.py --token ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
```

**Good**:
```yaml
# GOOD — secret passed as environment variable
- name: Run script
  env:
    API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
  run: python script.py  # reads from env, not args

# GOOD — mask in logs if must echo
- run: echo "::add-mask::${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}"
```

---

## Pattern C6: SLOW_WORKFLOW — ~8 findings

**What it is**: Full matrix on every PR; duplicated jobs; unnecessary steps not gated behind `if:` conditions; no caching of dependencies.

**Bad**:
```yaml
# BAD — full OS matrix on every PR
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
```

**Good**:
```yaml
# GOOD — fast matrix on PR, full matrix on main
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && '["ubuntu-latest"]' || '["ubuntu-latest", "windows-latest", "macos-latest"]' }}
    python-version: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && '["3.11"]' || '["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]' }}

# GOOD — cache dependencies
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}
```

## Pattern C7: STALE_COVERAGE_BASELINE — 1 confirmed finding (PR #867 / issue #870)

**What it is**: Setting a `--cov-fail-under` ratchet floor from a local measurement taken without erasing `.coverage` first. `pytest-cov` accumulates data across runs — a stale file from unit tests inflates the integration coverage number, and the floor is set too high. CI fails because it starts clean.

**Bad**:
```bash
# BAD — stale .coverage from unit runs pollutes the measurement
pytest tests/ -m "integration" --cov=fo --cov-report=term-missing
# Reports 51% — but unit test data is mixed in
# → You set --cov-fail-under=51, CI fails with 35%
```

**Good**:
```bash
# GOOD — always erase first so the measurement is clean
bash .claude/scripts/measure-integration-coverage.sh
# Equivalent to: coverage erase && pytest tests/ -m "integration" --cov=fo ...
```

**Pre-generation check**: Before setting or bumping any `--cov-fail-under` floor, run:
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/measure-integration-coverage.sh
```
Use only the `TOTAL` line from that output. Never use a number from a run that did not start with `coverage erase`.

---

## Pattern C8: VERSION_FABRICATION — 1 critical finding (PR #846)

**What it is**: A `>=X.Y.Z` version constraint added to `pyproject.toml` where that version
does not exist on PyPI. Claude or the author invented a version number without verifying it.
When `pip install` resolves the constraint it either silently installs an older version (if
the constraint resolves by coincidence) or fails entirely.

**Bad**:
```toml
# BAD — rank-bm25 0.7.2 does not exist on PyPI; latest is 0.2.2
[project.optional-dependencies]
search = [
    "rank-bm25>=0.7.2",
]
```

**Good**:
```bash
# ALWAYS verify the version exists before writing the constraint
pip index versions rank-bm25
# → Available versions: 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.2.0, ...

# THEN write the real latest version
```
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
search = [
    "rank-bm25>=0.2.2",
]
```

**Pre-generation check**: Before adding or bumping ANY dependency version in `pyproject.toml`,
run `pip index versions <package-name>` to confirm the version exists on PyPI. Never invent
a version number from memory or documentation — packages on PyPI rarely exceed their latest
published version.

**CI enforcement**: `check_pypi_versions.py` pre-commit hook (added after PR #846).

---

## Rule of Thumb

Before writing any CI config:
1. **C4**: `grep "cov-fail-under" pyproject.toml` — use this exact number everywhere; after changing it, grep all docs for the old value
2. **C7**: Measure integration coverage with `bash .claude/scripts/measure-integration-coverage.sh` — never from a dirty local env
3. **C8**: Run `pip index versions <pkg>` before writing any version constraint in `pyproject.toml`
4. **C3**: Search `@lru_cache` + `environ` — remove cache if found
5. **C2**: Add `if: github.event_name == 'push'` guard to external write actions
6. **C1**: No wall-clock time assertions in tests (`assert duration < N`)
