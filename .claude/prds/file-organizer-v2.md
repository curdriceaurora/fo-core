# File Organizer v2.0 - Product Requirements Document

## Vision

Make digital file organization effortless, intelligent, and privacy-respecting through state-of-the-art local AI models.

## Problem Statement

Knowledge workers spend an average of 9.3 hours per week searching for files and organizing their digital workspace. Existing solutions either:

1. Rely on cloud services (privacy concerns)
2. Use simple rule-based organization (limited intelligence)
3. Require manual categorization (time-consuming)

## Solution

File Organizer v2.0 uses state-of-the-art AI models (Qwen2.5 text + vision) running 100% locally to:

- Understand file content intelligently
- Generate meaningful folder structures
- Create descriptive filenames
- Organize 15+ file types automatically
- Preserve complete privacy (zero cloud dependencies)

## Current Status (Phase 1 Complete)

### What's Working ✅

- **Text Processing**: 9 formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, EPUB)
- **Image Processing**: 6 formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF) with OCR
- **Video Processing**: 5 formats (basic first-frame analysis)
- **Quality**: 100% meaningful names on tested files
- **Architecture**: Modern Python 3.12+, modular, type-safe
- **Performance**: ~7s/text file, ~4min/image

### Known Issues ⚠️

- **Critical**: Image processing speed (240s/image needs optimization)
- Vision model loading occasionally fails (restart Ollama)
- Video only analyzes first frame (multi-frame planned Phase 3)

## Target Users

1. **Sarah - Freelance Designer**: Thousands of project files, client assets
2. **David - PhD Researcher**: Hundreds of papers, datasets, notes
3. **Emily - Small Business Owner**: Invoices, receipts, product photos
4. **Alex - Privacy Advocate**: Wants local-only solution

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 1,000 active users by Month 6
- **Quality**: >95% meaningful file names
- **Time Saved**: >9 hours/week per user

## Technical Architecture

### Current Stack

```yaml
Core:
  Language: Python 3.12+
  Framework: Ollama (model serving)

AI Models:
  Text: Qwen2.5 3B Instruct Q4_K_M (1.9 GB)
  Vision: Qwen2.5-VL 7B Q4_K_M (6.0 GB)

Libraries:
  File Processing: PyMuPDF, python-docx, pandas, python-pptx, ebooklib
  NLP: NLTK
  UI: Rich (terminal)
  Logging: loguru
```

### Planned Additions

- **Phase 2**: Typer (CLI), Textual (TUI), PyYAML (config), PyInstaller (executables)
- **Phase 3**: faster-whisper (audio), ffmpeg-python (video)
- **Phase 4**: imagededup (perceptual hashing), scikit-learn (similarity)
- **Phase 5**: Redis, watchdog, Docker
- **Phase 6**: FastAPI, HTMX, websockets

## Key Differentiators

1. **Privacy-First**: 100% local processing, no cloud
2. **State-of-the-Art AI**: Qwen2.5 > GPT-3.5 for file organization
3. **Multi-Modal**: Text + images + videos (audio coming)
4. **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable, customizable
5. **Quality**: 100% meaningful names vs generic patterns

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- Minimum 16 GB RAM (8 GB works but constrained)
- 10 GB storage for AI models
- Python 3.12+ required
- macOS/Linux (Windows Phase 2)

### Business Constraints

- Open source commitment (core features free)
- Privacy-first (no telemetry without opt-in)
- Single developer initially (community later)

### Assumptions

- Users want automated organization
- Privacy is a key differentiator
- Current file types cover 90% of use cases
- Ollama is stable enough for production

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks

1. **Image Processing Speed** (HIGH)
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 2 optimization (model tuning, GPU support, batch processing)

2. **Low User Adoption** (MEDIUM)
   - **Mitigation**: Strong marketing, video tutorials, clear value proposition

3. **Memory Constraints** (MEDIUM)
   - **Mitigation**: Batch processing, smaller model options, streaming

4. **Ollama Instability** (LOW)
   - **Mitigation**: Restart procedures documented, fallback to llama.cpp
