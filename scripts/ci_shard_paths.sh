# ci_shard_paths.sh — single source of truth for the 6-shard test split.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ci_shard_paths.sh <shard_number>
# Prints a space-separated list of pytest path arguments to stdout.
#
# Both ci.yml (push) and ci-full.yml (daily) import this script so the mapping
# stays in sync. When test directories are added or moved, update ONLY this
# file; both pipelines will pick up the change automatically.
#
# Shard sizing goal: ~3 000-4 500 test functions per shard, keeping runtime
# balanced without over-fragmenting the matrix. After fixing the websocket
# queue-task cleanup in tests/api/test_realtime.py, the async-heavy API and web
# suites can run safely under xdist again, so the emergency micro-shards are no
# longer needed.
