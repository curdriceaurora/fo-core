## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Desktop app consolidated on pywebview** — removed the Tauri v2 / Rust / sidecar architecture
  in favour of a pure-Python approach: a single `fo-desktop` process starts uvicorn in
  a daemon thread and displays the web UI in a native OS window via pywebview. No Rust toolchain,
  no npm, no sidecar renaming steps required.
- **Build pipeline** — `python scripts/build.py --desktop` now produces a standalone pywebview
  desktop binary (`fo-desktop-{version}-{platform}-{arch}`) via PyInstaller, in
  addition to the existing CLI binary.
- **CI** — `build.yml` no longer requires the Rust toolchain or `cargo test`; the `test-rust`
  job has been removed and `release` now depends only on `build`.

### Removed

- `desktop/src-tauri/` — Rust source, Cargo.toml, tauri.conf.json, capabilities, build.rs
- `desktop/package.json` — npm/Tauri dev scripts
- Sidecar copy steps from `scripts/build_linux.sh`, `scripts/build_macos.sh`,
  `scripts/build_windows.ps1`, and `scripts/build_windows.iss`
- `TAURI_SIGNING_*` environment variables from CI workflow

### Security

- Accepted risk for `ecdsa` (GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp, HIGH): transitive via `python-jose`; JWT algorithm is HS256 so `ecdsa` is never invoked
- Accepted risk for `diskcache` (GHSA-w8v5-vhqr-4h9v, MODERATE): transitive via `llama-cpp-python`; never imported by application code

## [2.0.0-alpha.3] - 2026-03-26

### Quality & Stability Summary

This release contains **zero new user-facing features**—it is a pure quality and stability release covering 50 commits between March 9-26, 2026. The focus is on test infrastructure hardening, bug fixes, dependency updates, and security improvements that raise the project's reliability floor.

### Changed

- **Core Module Complexity Reduction** (#977): Refactored core modules to reduce cognitive complexity and improve maintainability
- **Test Parametrization** (#965, #966): Converted repetitive test cases to parametrized tests, reducing code duplication and improving coverage

- **pytest-timeout Compatibility** (#970): Pinned `pytest-timeout<2.4.0` to fix Windows CI crash
- **Path Keyword Matching** (f9ff398): Fixed feature extractor to match path keywords as exact components, not substrings
- **File Count Accuracy** (#937): Fixed deduplicated file counting in `OrganizationResult`
- **Threading Synchronization** (507cb35): Replaced busy-wait loop with `threading.Event().wait()` in test_warmup
- **Integration Test Stability** (#945): Fixed 5 failing integration tests on main branch
- **Flaky Assertions** (5b25653): Widened caplog scope to fix flaky cache-hit log assertion on Python 3.12

### Added
