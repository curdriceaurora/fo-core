    Manages PID files for daemon process tracking.

    PID files record the process ID of a running daemon so that
    other processes (or the user) can detect whether the daemon is
    active and send it signals.

    Example:
        >>> manager = PidFileManager()
        >>> pid_path = Path("/tmp/daemon.pid")
        >>> manager.write_pid(pid_path)
        >>> assert manager.is_running(pid_path)
