Machine Learning Approaches to Drug Discovery

Abstract:
This paper explores the application of deep learning models to accelerate pharmaceutical drug discovery. We present a novel neural network architecture that predicts molecular binding affinity with 92% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional computational chemistry methods.

Introduction:
Traditional drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, often taking 10-15 years and costing billions of dollars. Machine learning offers the potential to dramatically reduce both time and cost by predicting promising drug candidates earlier in the pipeline.

Methods:
We trained a graph convolutional network (GCN) on a dataset of 1.2 million known protein-ligand interactions. The model architecture includes attention mechanisms to identify key structural features that contribute to binding affinity.

Results:
Our model achieved 92% accuracy on held-out test data, compared to 78% for traditional docking methods. The model identified 15 novel drug candidates for further experimental validation.

Conclusion:
Deep learning shows significant promise for accelerating drug discovery pipelines while reducing costs.

Homemade Sourdough Bread

This classic sourdough bread recipe produces a crusty exterior with a soft, tangy interior. Perfect for sandwiches or toast.

Ingredients:
- 500g bread flour
- 350g water (70% hydration)
- 100g active sourdough starter
- 10g salt

Instructions:

1. Mix: Combine flour and water, let rest 30 minutes (autolyse)
2. Add starter and salt, mix until combined
3. Bulk fermentation: 4-6 hours at room temperature, fold every 30 minutes for first 2 hours
4. Shape: Gently shape into a round boule
5. Final proof: 2-4 hours at room temperature or overnight in fridge
6. Score: Make deep cuts on top with a sharp blade
7. Bake: 450°F for 20 minutes with steam, then 25 minutes without steam

Tips:
- Use a Dutch oven for better crust
- Starter should be bubbly and active
- Dough should increase by 50% during bulk fermentation
- Internal temperature should reach 205°F when done

# Complete Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It adds collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and project management tools.

## Basic Git Commands

### Starting a Repository
```bash
git init                    # Initialize new repository
git clone <url>            # Clone existing repository
```

### Making Changes
```bash
git add <file>             # Stage changes
git add .                  # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"    # Commit with message
git status                 # Check repository status
```

### Working with Remotes
```bash
git remote add origin <url>  # Add remote repository
git push origin main         # Push changes to remote
git pull origin main         # Pull changes from remote
git fetch                    # Fetch without merging
```

### Branching
```bash
git branch                   # List branches
git branch <name>           # Create new branch
git checkout <name>         # Switch to branch
git merge <name>            # Merge branch
```

## Best Practices
1. Commit often with clear messages
2. Pull before you push
3. Use branches for new features
4. Write descriptive commit messages
5. Review code before merging

## Common Workflows

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push to remote: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
4. Open pull request on GitHub
5. Review and merge

This workflow keeps the main branch stable while allowing parallel development.
