"""Config-schema migration registry.

F6 (hardening roadmap #159): explicit version-bump handling for
serialized ``AppConfig`` dicts. When :data:`config.schema.CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
is bumped, register a migration here that transforms the pre-bump
dict shape into the post-bump shape. ``ConfigManager.load`` walks
the registry at read time so old ``config.yaml`` files upgrade
automatically on next launch.

Contract
--------
- Each entry maps a *source* version string to a callable
  ``(data: dict) -> dict`` that returns the post-migration data.
- Migrations chain: if the on-disk version is ``"0.5"`` and current
  is ``"1.5"``, and there are migrations for ``"0.5"`` and ``"1.0"``,
  both run in sequence. The migration for version *X* produces the
  data shape at version *X+1*.
- Migrations must be idempotent — running twice on already-migrated
  data should be a no-op. This simplifies recovery after a partial
  load failure.
- Migrations never mutate their input in place; they may, but must
  return the result to signal intent.

Backwards/future-compat
-----------------------
- A config with a version *newer* than ``CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION``
  cannot be migrated (we don't have the newer migrations). The
  load path logs a loud WARNING and proceeds best-effort — refusing
  would strand users mid-upgrade.
- A config with a version that has no registered migration AND is
  not the current version is also treated as best-effort with a
  WARNING.

    the post-migration version from the next registered key — which
    applied the wrong transform when the registry had gaps (e.g.
    ``{"0.5", "2.0"}`` with no ``"1.0"``: after the 0.5 migration
    produced 1.0-shaped data, the walker jumped ``current`` to 2.0
    and ran the 2.0 migration on 1.0-shaped data, silently corrupting
