"""Crash-safe atomic state-file writers (Epic B.atomic / B1a + B1b).

Every persistent state file this project writes (config YAML, suggestion
feedback, rule manager, JD system, PARA migration manifest, embedder
pickle cache, event discovery state, audit log, VS Code command stream,
...) must be crash-safe: a mid-write crash or a concurrent writer must
never leave the file truncated or half-written.

The fix is the temp-file-plus-``os.replace()`` pattern, exposed here via
four helpers:

- :func:`atomic_write_text`  — UTF-8 (or caller-specified) text payload.
- :func:`atomic_write_bytes` — in-memory binary payload.
- :func:`atomic_write_with`  — streaming-callback form for writers that
  stream into the handle (e.g. :func:`pickle.dump`) and would otherwise
  require buffering the full payload in RAM.
- :func:`append_durable`     — single-record fsynced append, for log-
  style files where order matters and truncate-replace is wrong (audit
  log, VS Code JSONL).

All four write to a temp file *in the destination's parent directory*,
``fsync`` the contents, ``os.replace`` into the final name (atomic on
POSIX and Windows for same-filesystem renames), then fsync the parent
directory on POSIX so the rename itself is durable. Directory fsync is a
no-op on Windows — see :func:`utils.atomic_io.fsync_directory`.

Invariants upheld by every helper:

1. **Atomicity.** A reader opening the target at any point during the
   write either sees the old contents or the new contents, never a
   mixture or an empty file.
2. **No temp-file residue.** On success *or* failure, no ``*.tmp``
   artifact is left in the destination directory.
3. **Surface missing parents.** The helpers do NOT auto-create parent
   directories. Callers that need ``mkdir -p`` must do it explicitly
   (preserves the existing :meth:`pathlib.Path.mkdir` discipline at
   every site and prevents silent masking of config-path bugs).
