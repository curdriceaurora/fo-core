"""Credential-redacting ``logging.Filter`` (A3, hardening roadmap).

Project-wide safety net for the common shapes in which API keys, tokens,
passwords and bearer credentials accidentally end up in log records. The
existing model-client code already avoids logging the key directly (see
``models/_openai_client.py:74`` and ``models/_claude_client.py:69``, both of
which log ``type(e).__name__`` rather than the exception message), but
future code paths can still reach a ``logger.info("api_key=%s", ...)`` by
accident — the filter exists so the mistake fails closed.

Contract:

- ``CredentialRedactingFilter.filter`` always returns ``True``. The filter's
  job is redaction, not level-based suppression — handler levels and
  downstream filters still decide emission.
- Both the inline message (``record.msg``) and the positional format args
  (``record.args``) are scrubbed. ``record.getMessage()`` continues to work.
- ``REDACTED`` is a module-level public constant so tests and integration
  assertions can reference the exact replacement token without duplicating
  its string form.

The filter is attached to the root logger in ``cli.main`` so every
``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` inherits the protection.

    Python ``logging`` applies ``Logger`` filters only at the logger where a

    ancestor filters. Attaching a filter to the root logger therefore does
    NOT cover records emitted by child loggers (the common case — every
    ``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` in ``src/``).

    The fix is to wrap the global ``LogRecordFactory`` so redaction happens
    at record construction time, before any logger/handler sees it. Every
    record — regardless of originating logger or handler chain — is
    redacted. For symmetry we also add the filter to the root logger and
    any ``extra_loggers`` so ``logger.filter(record)`` continues to apply
    the same sanitisation to records constructed outside our factory
    (rare, but possible).

    Idempotent: calling twice installs exactly one factory wrapper (the
    second call is a no-op if our wrapper is already the active factory).
    Tests that need to restore the original factory can read
    ``filter_instance._original_factory`` and pass it back to
    ``logging.setLogRecordFactory``.

    Args:
        extra_loggers: Additional named loggers to attach the filter to
            as a belt-and-suspenders symmetric install.

    Returns:
        The installed filter instance. Callers may hold it for teardown.
