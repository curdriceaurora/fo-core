"""PID file management for the daemon.

Provides the PidFileManager class for creating, reading, and removing
PID files, plus checking whether a recorded process is still alive.

F2 (hardening roadmap #159) — PID-reuse race protection:
Pre-F2 PID files stored only the integer PID. When a daemon crashed
and the OS later recycled its PID for an unrelated process, the next
call to ``is_running`` reported the daemon as alive — because the PID
still existed, just for a different process. F2 introduces a JSON
record format that also captures the process start-time
(``psutil.Process(pid).create_time()``); ``is_running`` rejects records
whose PID is alive but whose start-time doesn't match.

Backward compat: legacy text-only PID files still read and work (with
a documented degradation — no recycling detection for those).
