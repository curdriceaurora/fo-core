"""CLI-layer path validation — the user-input boundary for fo commands.

Epic A.cli (hardening roadmap #154, §2.5) wires every path-taking CLI
command through this helper before any filesystem operation. Two public
surfaces:

- ``resolve_cli_path(path, *, must_exist, must_be_dir)`` — resolve a single
  argument, surface existence / type errors as ``typer.BadParameter``
  (so typer prints a usage-level error rather than a traceback).
- ``validate_pair(input_dir, output_dir)`` — cross-argument coherence
  for commands that take both an input and an output directory. Rejects
  the classic ``organize IN IN/sub`` footgun where output sits inside
  input, plus the mirror case and the identity case.

Neither helper uses ``core.path_guard.validate_within_roots`` directly:
that helper is for validating *derived* paths against a pre-declared
root set (used inside service-layer walkers). The CLI boundary doesn't
have a pre-declared root — the user's arguments **are** the roots.
This helper exists to resolve + sanity-check those arguments before
they become the allowed roots for downstream code.

    Normalises ``..``, resolves symlinks, anchors relatives against the
    current working directory, and — by default — asserts the path exists
    and is a directory. Callers that accept a file (``fo analyze FILE``)
    or a not-yet-created output directory (``fo organize IN OUT`` where
    OUT doesn't exist yet) opt out via the two keyword flags.

    Args:
        path: The typer-delivered ``Path`` argument. May be relative,
            contain ``..``, or be a symlink — all normalised.
        must_exist: If True (default), raise ``typer.BadParameter`` when

            for commands that take a file argument.

    Returns:

        ``.is_absolute()`` and a fully-normalised form.

            path-exists-but-not-a-directory (when ``must_be_dir=True``), or
