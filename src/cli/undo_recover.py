"""F7.1 step 8 / §8.2: ``fo recover`` — preview pending durable_move recovery.

The command reads the durable_move journal under ``LOCK_SH`` (per §6.5),
calls the pure :func:`plan_recovery_actions` planner (§8.1), and renders
the planned recovery actions as a table for operator visibility.

Critical: this command is read-only. It calls only the planner — never
the executor. The next CLI start (which runs ``sweep``) is what actually
performs the planned actions. ``main_callback`` skips the startup sweep
when ``recover`` is the invoked subcommand to preserve this contract
(codex lCbV / coderabbit lDDy).

Exit-code contract:

- ``0`` if no actionable entries (no ``retain`` / ``unlink_src_then_drop``
  / ``drop_tmp_then_drop`` rows). Operator-visible WARNING-level drops
  (e.g. stranded ``dir_move started`` per §5.3) DO appear in the
  rendered table but don't bump the exit code — sweep would just drop
  them, no recovery action runs.
- ``1`` if any actionable verb is planned, so scripts can detect
  "needs cleanup".

The §5.1 STARTED disambiguation tier (pre-replace / post-replace /
v1-ambiguous) appears in the rendered reason for v2 ``move started``
rows so operators can correlate sweep's planned action with on-disk
state without re-reading the journal.
