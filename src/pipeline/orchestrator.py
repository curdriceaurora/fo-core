    Connects file discovery to processing and organization.  Supports
    both batch mode (process a list of files) and watch mode (react
    to file-system events in real-time).

    The orchestrator can operate in two modes:

    1. **Stage-based** (new): supply a ``stages`` list of
       :class:`~interfaces.PipelineStage` instances.
       Each file flows through the stages in order.
    2. **Legacy** (default): uses the built-in router, processor pool,
       and ``_process_with_processor`` / ``_organize_file`` helpers
       for backward compatibility.

    Dry-run mode is enabled by default for safety.  Files are only
    moved when both ``dry_run=False`` and ``auto_organize=True`` in
    config.

                as I/O stages.  For thread-safety, the current
                implementation caps the effective prefetched stage count

        Splits *stages* at ``effective_prefetch_stages`` (capped at 1 for

        safe for concurrent initialisation): the I/O stages are submitted to
        a dedicated :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for
        upcoming files while the compute stages run on the calling thread for
        the current file.

        At most ``self._prefetch_depth`` I/O futures are outstanding at
        any time.  If a ``memory_limiter`` is configured, no new futures
        are opened when ``limiter.check()`` returns *False*.

        An error in a prefetched file's I/O stages does not crash the
        batch; a failed :class:`~interfaces.StageContext`
        is returned and the compute stages are still attempted (they will
        short-circuit on ``context.failed``).

        Per-file ``ProcessingResult.duration_ms`` is measured from the
        moment the I/O future is *submitted* (not when it completes), so
        the reported wall-clock time covers prefetched I/O latency as well
        as compute time.  For files that fall through to the sequential
        inline path (no outstanding future), timing starts just before
        ``_run_io`` is called.

            files: Ordered list of file paths to process.
            stages: Snapshot of the stage list taken by the caller.
