"""Durable move helper for undo rollback operations.

F7 (hardening roadmap #159) — replacement for ``shutil.move`` in the
rollback path.

Contract
--------

:func:`durable_move` is:

- **Atomic on same device**: uses ``os.replace`` which is a single
  rename syscall; POSIX and Windows both guarantee either the old
  name or the new name is visible, never both + neither.
- **Durable + idempotent on cross-device (EXDEV)**: writes a journal
  entry before the copy starts, fsyncs the destination data +
  directory before marking the entry as copied, then unlinks the
  source and marks the entry as done. A crash anywhere in the
  sequence leaves the journal in a recoverable state — either the
  destination doesn't exist yet (safe to retry) or it's complete
  (just need to unlink the source).

:func:`sweep` runs at CLI startup and walks the journal to complete
or roll back any unfinished operations. Without the sweep, a crash
mid-move would leave ``.journal`` entries and possibly orphan files
on disk; with it, the invariant is "after startup, no journal
entries exist that refer to files that require action."

"Atomic" is a strong word. This helper is NOT atomic across EXDEV —
there's a window between ``os.replace`` of the copy and ``unlink``
of the source during which both files exist on disk. The journal +
sweep make that window observable and recoverable, not invisible.

Journal format
--------------

JSON lines, one operation per line. Fields:

- ``op`` — always ``"move"`` in this helper. Reserved for future
  operations (``copy``, ``symlink``, etc.) that might share the
  journal.
- ``src``, ``dst`` — absolute paths as strings.
- ``state`` — one of ``"started"``, ``"copied"``, ``"done"``.

States progress monotonically. An entry may appear multiple times
in the journal if it was updated (we append rather than rewrite for
crash safety — the sweep reads the LAST state for each (src, dst)
pair). The sweep truncates the journal once it finishes, so
steady-state size is bounded.

    Sequence is carefully ordered so a crash at any point leaves
    recoverable state:

       deletes (never-created or partial) destination.
    2. Copy ``src`` → ``<dst>.tmp`` inside ``dst.parent`` (same-fs
       as ``dst``). Copy errors propagate — the journal has an
       unresolved ``started`` entry that sweep cleans up.
    3. Fsync the temp file and its directory. Without the directory
       fsync, a power loss after ``os.replace`` could leave the
       directory entry pointing at an inode whose pages haven't hit
       disk — a classic atomic-write footgun.
    4. ``os.replace(tmp, dst)``. Atomic because tmp + dst are on the
       same filesystem (dst.parent).
    5. Append ``copied`` entry. Crash here = destination complete,
       source still exists; sweep unlinks the source.
    6. Unlink source. Crash here = destination complete, source
       gone; state is effectively ``done`` but no ``done`` entry is
       logged yet. Sweep would redundantly try to unlink a
       nonexistent source, which is a no-op.
