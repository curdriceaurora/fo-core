"""F8.1 race-safe trash deletion API (issue #202).

Closes the check-then-delete TOCTOU race in the F8 trash-GC surface. A
predicate alone (:func:`is_trash_safe_to_delete`) leaves the window between
the check and the delete unprotected — a concurrent rollback can journal a
``move started`` entry between the predicate read and the unlink, and the
caller would unlink a path the rollback was about to touch.

:class:`TrashGC` provides one blessed deletion entry point that performs
the in-flight check AND the deletion under a single ``LOCK_EX`` on
``<journal>.lock`` (per #201 §6.1). For directories, the lock is held
only for an atomic rename into a staging path (``.pending-delete-<uuid>``);
the slow ``rmtree`` runs unlocked, so concurrent writers are blocked for
microseconds regardless of trash subtree size.

Public surface (see :class:`TrashGC` for details):

- ``TrashGC(trash_dir, *, journal_path=None)`` — constructor; eagerly
  cleans ``.pending-delete-*`` orphans from prior crashed deletions.
- ``TrashGC.safe_delete(path) -> TrashDeleteOutcome`` — single race-safe
  deletion entry point covering files, symlinks (incl. dangling and
  symlinks to directories), and directories.
- ``TrashDeleteResult`` (StrEnum, six variants) and
  ``TrashDeleteOutcome`` (frozen dataclass) — public outcome types.

Spec + operator reference: ``docs/internal/F8-1-trash-gc-design.md`` and
``docs/internal/F8-1-trash-gc.md``.
